# NESTED LIST..

# my2Dlist = [[1,2,3,4], [5,6,7,8] , [9,10,11,12] , [13,14,15,16]]

# print(my2Dlist)

# print(my2Dlist[3])

# NESTED LIST NEED NOT TO BE HOMOGEOUS:

# my2Dlist = [[1,2,3,'a'],[5,6,7,'cat'],[9,10,'e',12],['beta',14,15,16]]

# print(my2Dlist)

#ARBITARY LIST
# - Nested list need not be of same length.

# my2Dlist = [[1,2,3,'a'],[5,6,7],[9,10,11,12],[13,14,15,'beta']]
# print(my2Dlist)

# - Nested list can have arbitary depth as well.
